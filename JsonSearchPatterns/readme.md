XPath search can be challenging with JSON due to the lack of a natural hierarchy and limited support for JSON-specific features. JSONâ€™s key-value pair and array structure make it difficult to define XPath expressions that work consistently across different JSON structures. XPath also lacks built-in support for features like array handling and attribute value filtering in JSON. In contrast, search patterns like JSON SelectTokens are specifically designed for JSON and provide a more intuitive and streamlined way to search and navigate JSON data, leveraging its inherent features and flexibility. They offer a simplified syntax and better compatibility with JSON structures, making them easier to use for searching and selecting data in JSON documents.
