This code defines a serverless application using Azure Durable Functions to handle, validate, process, and respond to HTTP POST requests containing a user's name. The flow begins with an HTTP-triggered function (func-message-validator) that starts an orchestration (func-message-orchestrator) and waits for its completion. The orchestrator parses the incoming JSON payload to extract the name, then calls a series of activity functions: func-validate-input ensures the name contains only letters and spaces, func-process-input handles any additional processing, and func-say-hello returns a greeting. Logging is integrated throughout to aid in monitoring and debugging the asynchronous execution pipeline.
