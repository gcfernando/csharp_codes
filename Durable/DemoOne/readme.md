This code defines an Azure Functions-based workflow using Durable Functions. The FunctionClient class exposes an HTTP-triggered function (func-message-validator) that accepts a POST request with a JSON body containing a name field. The function then triggers an orchestration (func-message-orchestrator), passing the request body as input. The orchestration parses the name and calls an activity function (func-say-hello) that generates a greeting. The orchestration's result, which contains the greeting, is returned to the client. The ModifyMessage class defines the activity function (func-say-hello) that logs a message and returns a string greeting using the provided name. The orchestration ensures that the entire process is handled reliably with Azure Durable Task Framework, allowing for the orchestration and activity functions to run asynchronously while maintaining state across function executions.
