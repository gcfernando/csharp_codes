This code provides two different ways to interact with an AI-powered system to generate responses based on a given query. The first method makes use of an external service to handle communication, allowing for an efficient and structured way to send messages and receive responses. It sets up a client, configures parameters like creativity level and response length, and then sends a request with both system-provided and user-provided messages. The response is then extracted and returned.

The second method takes a more hands-on approach by manually creating and sending a request over the internet. It builds a request message in a structured format, including key details like the AI’s guiding instructions and the user's input. The request is then sent, and once a response is received, it is processed to extract the relevant text before returning the final answer.

Both approaches aim to achieve the same goal—retrieving useful and relevant responses based on input—but they differ in how they manage communication. One method relies on a structured interface that simplifies interactions, while the other offers more direct control over the request and response handling.
