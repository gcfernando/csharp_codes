The code provided demonstrates a programming approach where multiple operations are performed concurrently. This approach allows for efficient execution of tasks while handling any errors that may occur. By utilizing asynchronous programming techniques, the code improves performance by allowing operations to run in parallel, reducing overall execution time. Additionally, it includes error handling logic to catch and display any exceptions that might arise during the execution of these tasks.
