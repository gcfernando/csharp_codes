This program explores how data can be viewed and modified in different ways. It starts with a number and looks at it from another perspective, then changes it and sees how it affects the original value. It also does the same with a custom shape and a list of small values, showing how the same data can appear differently depending on how you look at it. In the end, it modifies the data in one way and observes the changes in another.
